# PYTHON_Numpy_Pandas
# INTRODUCTION
This repository contains exercises focused on using NumPy and Pandas, two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

NumPy is a powerful library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and offers data structures and functions specifically designed to work with structured data. It provides DataFrame and Series objects, making it easy to manipulate and analyze data in Python.

# THEORY
## NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
The key features of NumPy :
* N-Dimensional Arrays: Efficiently handles large datasets with ndarray objects.
* Mathematical Functions: Offers a wide range of functions for mathematical operations.
* Broadcasting: Facilitates arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes.
* Indexing and Slicing: Supports advanced techniques for extracting and modifying data.
* Performance: Highly optimized for speed, outperforming pure Python implementations.

## Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library built on top of NumPy. It provides data structures and functions designed for working with structured data, making it a crucial tool for data analysis in Python.

The Key Features of Pandas:
* DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
* Series: A one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type.
* Data Alignment: Automatically aligns data based on labels for seamless operations.
* Handling Missing Data: Tools for detecting, filling, or dropping missing values.
* Data Operations: Functions for filtering, grouping, merging, and reshaping data.
* Input/Output Tools: Supports reading and writing data in various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.).


# EXERCISES
### 1. Exercise 1: 

Create a numpy array containing the numbers from 1 to 10, and then reshape it to a 2x5 matrix. 

 

### 2. Exercise 2: 

Create a numpy array containing the numbers from 1 to 20, and then extract the elements between the 5th and 15th index. 

 

### 3. Exercise 3: 

Create a Pandas series with the following data: {'apples': 3, 'bananas': 2, 'oranges': 1}. Then, add a new item to the series with the key 'pears' and the value 4. 

 

### 4. Exercise 4:

Create a dataframe with the following columns: name, age, and gender. The dataframe should have 10 rows of data. 

 

### 5. Exercise 5:

Add a new column to the data frame created in question 1, called occupation. The values for this column should be Programmer, Manager, and Analyst, corresponding to the rows in the dataframe. 

 

### 6. Exercise 6:

Select the rows of the dataframe where the age is greater than or equal to 30. 

 

### 7. Exercise 7:

Convert this dataframe to a csv file and read that csv file, finally display the contents. 

# CONCLUSION
This repository provides a solid foundation for understanding how to manipulate arrays and data structures using NumPy and Pandas
Both NumPy and Pandas are essential libraries for data analysis in Python. While NumPy provides the foundational support for numerical operations and array manipulation, Pandas builds on this foundation to offer powerful data structures and tools for analyzing and manipulating structured data. Together, they enable data scientists and analysts to perform efficient and effective data analysis tasks.
